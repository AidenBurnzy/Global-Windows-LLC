                                Today, I woke up wrapped in light,
                                Love in the air, and power in flight.
                                I breathed‚Äîand You were already there,
                                In the silence, in the sky, in the soul of the air.

                                I see You, Father, in all that You do‚Äî
                                Feeding the sparrow, painting the dew.
                                Warming the earth with the sun‚Äôs steady flame,
                                Calling me gently, whispering my name.

                                You handle the world with patient control,
                                Yet still You pause to nourish my soul.
                                You crafted the breath that fills my chest‚Äî
                                And in Your presence, I find my rest.

                                Thank You for the woman beside me each day,
                                With a love that reflects You in every way‚Äî
                                Her kindness, her patience, her mercy so wide,
                                A mirror of grace You placed at my side.

                                You, Father, are the man I long to become,
                                Strong in Your truth, humble and undone.
                                A son learning daily to lead and to bend,
                                To love without limit, to serve without end.

                                So today‚ÄîI breathe You in.
                                Today‚ÄîI rise again.
                                Not in my power, but Yours alone‚Äî
                                My Heavenly Father, my anchor, my home.

                                Reflection

                                Have you ever listened to a sermon, a worship song, or someone‚Äôs testimony and felt like
                                it was meant just for you? It hit a place deep inside you. But other times, even the
                                most powerful truth seems to bounce right off your heart. Why does that happen?

                                The answer often lies in the condition of the heart.

                                Sometimes our hearts are so full‚Äîof pain, disappointment, grief, bitterness‚Äîthat there‚Äôs
                                no room left for God‚Äôs Word to take root. It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt want to hear; it‚Äôs that
                                we can‚Äôt. The soil of our heart has been hardened by life. In those moments, we need
                                healing more than instruction.

                                The enemy loves to plant lies in our hearts‚Äîlies about our worth, about God‚Äôs love,
                                about forgiveness. Those lies grow like weeds and choke out truth.

                                But here‚Äôs the good news: God is the Master Gardener. He can heal any heart, no matter
                                how broken. And sometimes, He invites us to help tend to the hearts of others. That
                                starts not with preaching, but with compassion‚Äîwith understanding what someone has been
                                through, seeing their pain, and gently helping them clear space for God to work.

                                Everyone has a story. Their heart condition is part of their testimony. And when love
                                and truth are planted with care, God can bring a harvest out of even the hardest ground.

                                Challenge

                                This week, ask God to show you someone whose heart might be hurting or hardened. Instead
                                of offering answers, offer presence. Be the one who listens, understands, and reflects
                                Christ‚Äôs patience. You may be the one preparing their heart to receive the truth.

                                Also, reflect on your own heart. Is there pain or bitterness that‚Äôs crowding out God‚Äôs
                                Word? Invite Him to do some spiritual gardening.

                                Prayer

                                Lord, soften my heart. Pull up the weeds of pain, lies, and bitterness. Help me receive
                                Your Word with faith and joy. Show me how to love others enough to understand their pain
                                and help prepare their hearts for You. Thank You for never giving u p on broken soil. In
                                Jesus‚Äô name, amen.
                            </p>

                            <p class="writing-excerpt">
                                Standing on my own two feet There are moments in life when we can‚Äôt even remember
                                standing on our own two feet‚Äîbecause we weren‚Äôt. Those were the times Jesus was carrying
                                us through the storms, through the battles waged by the enemy. The devil, the god of
                                this world, will whisper lies: You‚Äôre a failure. You don‚Äôt deserve a good life because
                                of your past. He uses shame to blind your mind and keep you from the truth.

                                But here‚Äôs what God says: I knew you before you were even formed in the womb. I saw your
                                flaws, your mistakes, your struggles‚Äîand I still chose to love you. His love is
                                unconditional. No price tag. No conditions.

                                So ask yourself‚Äîdo you love others this way? Or does your love come with strings
                                attached? Jesus paid the price in advance so we wouldn‚Äôt have to. When we can‚Äôt stand,
                                He carries us. When we‚Äôre lost, He sends someone to lift us up. He is leading us to the
                                cross, but shame tries to convince us we don‚Äôt deserve forgiveness.

                                And here‚Äôs the truth: We don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the beauty of grace. It‚Äôs not about
                                deserving‚Äîit‚Äôs about receiving.

                                Jesus leads by example, and so should we. Love without conditions. Lift those who are
                                struggling. Carry them to the cross, just as Christ carried us.

                                Love wins. Every time.

                                This world is broken, but one person at a time, we can bring it back to the vision of
                                God‚Äôs plan.

                                Love you all.

                                Alone again Do you ever feel like you're surrounded by loved ones but still feel alone
                                inside? You're screaming for help, saying, "Here I am! I'm in pain!" All you need is for
                                someone to acknowledge your existence, but instead, you're met with silence. Why can't
                                they see the pain in your heart? Sometimes, you need to be alone and reach out to our
                                Heavenly Father, who tells you, "I see your pain, and I acknowledge you. I hear your
                                cries for love." Your flaws are a result of dealing with a world that's wronged you. If
                                someone would just say, "I see you," it would make a big difference. If you don't have a
                                Heavenly Father, where do you turn? If you've felt this way, know that the Lord knows I
                                have. I don't think I could handle people's coldness; it's always about them. But with
                                God, it's about you. Thank you, Jesus, for being with me tonight; I know I'm not alone.
                                Thank you for showing me love; I couldn't make it without you.

                            <p class="writing-excerpt">
                                Bible understanding I sometimes wonder why many people don‚Äôt understand the Bible, yet I
                                do. What is special about me that I have this gift?

                                Understanding.

                                I have spent years studying it, reading it, and living it. Now, in all things, I see how
                                Jesus works in my life. It‚Äôs similar to our careers‚ÄîI have spent decades honing my
                                craft. But if I were to ask my son, who works with data, to install a window, he would
                                be lost. He does not have the understanding.

                                It takes years to master a craft, whether in our careers or as stewards of Jesus Christ,
                                learning to understand His master plan for our lives. Until we gain that understanding,
                                the devil can create friction and wear in our lives.

                                Think about an engine. We can see every part operating: the crank spinning, driving the
                                pistons as they rotate. The camshaft, linked to a timing chain, is set perfectly to
                                drive the lifters, which move the pushrods, opening and closing the valves. The
                                distributor gears spin in perfect sync with the ignition system. At just the right
                                moment, the spark plugs fire, igniting the air-fuel mixture, which drives the pistons.

                                But what happens when the crank spins too slowly? When the camshaft is offset? When the
                                plugs don‚Äôt fire?

                                We damage the parts, and inevitably, the motor will die.

                                The devil is putting wear on us‚ÄîGod‚Äôs most amazing creation. We need to do the
                                maintenance‚Äîread the Bible‚Äîto keep that wear from destroying our lives. We may not fully
                                understand His Word, but we can all recognize where the devil has caused damage.

                                Thankfully, we can always turn to God‚Äôs mechanics‚Äîthose who have studied the inner
                                workings of His great masterpiece‚Äîto help guide us back to Him.

                                    Time

                                    Put some earbuds in and listen to the words. Turn it up‚Äîloud. Louder.

                                    God is the author of time. You get a check every day‚Äîthe same check goes out to
                                    everyone. You have a choice in what you do with it: waste it, invest it, or multiply
                                    it.

                                    Jesus said, ‚ÄúI am the way, the truth, and the life.‚Äù He is the way to God. Stop
                                    wasting time. I challenge you to start that relationship with Him today before it‚Äôs
                                    too late. Tomorrow‚Äôs check might bounce. But know this‚ÄîGod does not write a check He
                                    can‚Äôt cash.

                                    My mother loved Pink Floyd. I took her to the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour‚Äîshe was
                                    the designated driver. We had a very challenging relationship, but I chose
                                    unconditional love.

                                    My mother knew Jesus but not His promises, so she lived her life in bondage. She did
                                    her best, but this world destroyed her hope. I wish I could go back and teach her
                                    about God‚Äôs promises.

                                    Do you know someone living in bondage? If you have the keys to the Kingdom, open the
                                    door for them. Don‚Äôt wait until tomorrow.

                                    Thank you, Mother, for teaching me through watching you. Even as a child, I knew
                                    this couldn‚Äôt be God‚Äôs plan‚Äîthere was too much pain and hate. I saw the sacrifices
                                    you made for me, and I love you for them.

                                    We are all human, just doing the best we can. But the Bible is the book of life, and
                                    it will show you the way.
